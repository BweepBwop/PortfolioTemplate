# ðŸ“± **Creating a Portfolio App for a Friend**

This project is a **portfolio app** built with React Native to showcase my friend **Alyssa's** profile. The app provides a clean and interactive interface with animated text and a teal-themed design. It is designed to give a pleasant and professional look, featuring typing effects to introduce Alyssaâ€™s details in an engaging way.

## ðŸ”¨ **How I Made It**

1. **Set up the React Native environment**:  
   Installed `react-native` dependencies and created the project using the following:
   ```bash
   npx react-native init PortfolioApp
2. **Implemented Typed Animation**:  
   Used a custom hook to create the typing animation that reveals text letter by letter.

3. ** Designed the Layout with Flexbox**:
    Ensured that the text is aligned properly using absolute positioning and flexbox for the main view.

4. **Integrated the Theme**:
    Added a teal-inspired palette to create a pleasant user experience. All colors are consistent with the design theme.
